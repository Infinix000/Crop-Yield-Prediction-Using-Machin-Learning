# Crop Field Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict crop yields based on various factors such as rainfall, soil quality, and region-specific data. It leverages data science techniques to provide actionable insights for farmers and agricultural planners.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and prediction.
- `results/`: Output files such as predictions, visualizations, and model performance metrics.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize crop yield distributions across different regions.
- **Model Training**: Build and train predictive models using historical data.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions based on current conditions.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the relationship between rainfall, yield, and other factors.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
